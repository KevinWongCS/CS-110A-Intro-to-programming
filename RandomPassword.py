# Exercise 94: Random Password
###############################
# Write a function that generates a random password. The password should have a random length of between 7 and 10
# characters. Each character should be randomly selected from positions 33 to 126 in the ASCII table. Your function
# will not take any parameters. It will return the randomly generated password as its only result. Display the randomly
# generated password in your fileâ€™s main program. Your main program should only run when your solution has not been
# imported into another file.
#
# Hint: You will probably find the chr function helpful when completing this exercise. Detailed information
# about this function is available online.
